# Text-to-Morse-Code-Converter
This is a simple Python script that allows you to convert any text into Morse code.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository: 

        git clone https://github.com/Siddharth-2382/Text-to-Morse-Code-Converter.git
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned: 
        
        cd Text-to-Morse-Code-Converter
3. Run the script:

        python main.py
4. Enter the text you wish to convert into Morse code.
5. The Morse code translation of your text will be printed in the console.

## Dependencies
This script requires no external dependencies to run.

## Limitations
The script currently only supports conversion of letters, numbers, and basic punctuation. More advanced characters, such as accented letters, are not currently supported.

## Acknowledgments
This project was created as a learning exercise and is not intended for serious use. It was inspired by the many other text-to-Morse-code converters available online, and is based on the standard Morse code protocol.
